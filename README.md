Canadian Army Digital Nexus - Capstone Project

### A governance application that enables people from across their organization at all levels to submit innovation ideas for subsequent prioritization and resourcing.

## Needs: 
### - internet-facing web applications, thatâ€™s mobile friendly
### - That is highly intuitive/user-friendly
### - Facilitate idea intake, transparent, and organisational-wide understanding of what is being submitted
### - Provide the ability to offer feedback and ask questions to idea submittors
### - Automatic scoring based on predefined criteria to output a prioritisation list

This app is envisioned as a ui where lists of ideas are being used in subsequent steering committees.
In order to help decide which ideas to fund/resource to test validity before scaling up and out across the organisation.
