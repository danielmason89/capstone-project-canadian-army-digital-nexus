## Canadian Army Digital Nexus - Capstone Project

A governance application that enables people from across an organization at all levels to submit innovation ideas for subsequent prioritization and resourcing.

##What your application does:
This application can be used across an organization for idea management and prioritization over time.

## Why you used the technologies you used?
I chose to use the React framework, Next.js, alongside a postgresql database, and graphql with an apollo client and prisma orm to abstaract some of the set-up that would be otherwise required for working with plain react. I made use of these to query the database in a more efficient way were this app to continue being used and further build out in reaction to the inefficiencies of a REST-Api

## Some of the challenges you faced and features you hope to implement in the future:
 - Figuring out the right framework to use, and weghing the positives against the negatives
 - Looking over the database landscape and figuring out what type of database to use; relational versus document:
 the difference being that MongoDB is a non-relational database, while PostgreSQL is a relational database. While NoSQL databases work on storing data in key-value pairs  as one record, relational databases store data on different tables.
 - Looking over the different React based component libraries and choosing one that best fit the needs of the application.

## Needs: 
 - internet-facing web applications, thatâ€™s mobile friendly
 - That is highly intuitive/user-friendly
 - Facilitates idea intake, transparent, and organisational-wide understanding of what is being submitted
 - Provides the ability to offer feedback and ask questions to idea submittors
 - Automatic scoring based on predefined criteria to output a prioritisation list

This app is envisioned as a ui where lists of ideas are being used in subsequent steering committees.
In order to help decide which ideas to fund/resource to test validity before scaling up and out across the organisation.
